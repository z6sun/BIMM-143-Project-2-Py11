## Scientific Question
Since the research shows that Mycobacterium Vaccae is able to stimulate mouse T lymphocytes to generate cytokines, is it possible for Mycobacterium Vaccae to stimulate human T lymphocytes to produce the same cytokines?

## Scientific Hypothesis
If the interferon receptors of human T lymphocytes are similar to the interferon receptors of mouse T lymphocytes, then Mycobacterium Vaccae might be able to have the same impact which is to stimulate the human T lymphocytes to activate the human immune pathways to produce cytokines for immunotherapy.
